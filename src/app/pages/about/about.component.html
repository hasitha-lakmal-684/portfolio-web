<h1>About</h1>

<p>
  I am a Software Engineer with hands-on experience building web applications
  using Angular and Java. I focus on clean architecture, maintainable code,
  and predictable system behavior.

<p>
  My work emphasizes clarity, separation of concerns, and long-term
  maintainability over short-term visual polish.
